# csc420 Final Project
# Project.ipynb <br />
This is code from both of us. It is able to produce facial expression recognition given video input and output result video.<br />
# Trained model folder <br />
This folder has trained model for our project.<br />
Gender recognition model: weights9.20-0.94.h5<br />
Facial expression recognition model with higher accuracy: weights16.35-0.67.h5<br />
Initial facial expression recognition model: weights7.12-0.61.h5
<br />
# mingjie folder <br />
This folder has Mingjie Zhu's code for building and training CNN<br />
It also has some results for model training and facial expression recognition parts.<br />
<br />
# jilong folder <br />
<br />
This folder has JiLong Bi's code for video proessing, shot transition detection, face detection and gender recognition<br />
It also has some results and workflow for these parts.<br />
